# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Linked to www.caitsidener.com

This project is cleaned-up version of my portfolio. It incorporates Bootstrap and cleaned up CSS code. Bootstrap is useful because it makes my website look the same across all browsers, it allows for responsive styling, and a clean grid system (among other things).

Users can get started with the project on my About Page and navigate to my Vlog, Portfolio, and Contact Pages for further information about me. If you need help with the Bootstrap Portfolio, please leave a message on my contact page. 

I am the sole contributor to this project.
