                    <div class="fakeimg"><img class="blog-pic" alt="MySQL" src="assets/images/MySQL.png"></div>
                    <p>In class today, I learned about MySQL. Finally, all of my high school years learning how to use
                        Microsof Excel are paying off. Picking up on
                        the commands is intuitive. We started by creating a table
                        with columns which can store strings, integers, and booleans (among other things). I can make a
                        column required and assign individual keys to each row
                        of content.
                    </p>
                    <p>Adding the rows is a bit more taxing than I was expecting. For each new row, you have to write
                        "insert into 'table' + 'column title'" and then you indicate the values desired. To view new
                        values in the table, you then write a new line of code noting which content you would like to
                        display. In all, it is fairly easy going; however, I feel like the work of typing in the values
                        is a bit tedious.

                    <h2>Constructors</h2>
                    <h5><strong>Learning about Constructors at the KU Full Stack Bootcamp, Feb 2, 2019</strong></h5>
                    <div class="fakeimg"><img class="blog-pic" alt="Tamagotchi" src="assets/images/tamagotchi.jpg"></div>
                    <p>Growing up in the aughts meant an unhealthy obsession with Beanie Babies (oh, yeah. I had over
                        200, including TWO Princess Diana’s), a forever battle between loving Backstreet Boys or
                        N’Sync, the mandatory uniform of leggings with foot straps covered with white socks and an
                        oversized sweatshirt, and an anxiety-filled check in with my Tamagotchi. So, you could imagine
                        my surprise when I discovered that we would be making our own Tamagotchis with this handy tool
                        called a Constructor.
                    </p>
                    <p>Constructors are brilliant - I can set up an object with all of the pertinent details needed
                        and simply add the details with each related variable. What’s more? I can add functions within
                        my constructor to give my variables action or a purpose. If my Tamagotchi is tired? Create a
                        function the gives the little guy sleepy time and restores his energy points to max. It is a
                        fairly simple and fun tool to use, instead of creating separate objects for each variable.
                        Some problems I ran in to: remembering to call a function with the variable name in front (i.e
                        tamagotchi.feedMe()) and knowing when to create a function for an individual variable versus as
                        a part of the constructor. Overall, it was a fun day of learning and nostalgia!

                    <h2>Node JS</h2>
                    <h5><strong>Learning about Node at the KU Full Stack Bootcamp, Jan 26, 2019</strong></h5>
                    <div class="fakeimg"><img class="blog-pic" alt="NodeJS" src="assets/images/Nodejs.png"></div>
                    <p>One of the biggest mistakes I make as a new developer is where to put new files. I’ll just nest
                        my project here, within twelve folders that are completely unrelated and seem to all start with
                        the number zero. This decision made my initial experience with Node more difficult than it
                        needed to be. Everyone else was pulling up their file in the Terminal (yes, Bash, but I’m a
                        Apple lady) and squealing with delight when they ran their code that console.logged “Hello
                        World”, while I was still cd’ing into the wrong folders.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once I worked out my issues (I literally had to right click on the file and choose “Open in
                        Terminal”), I was able to experience the magic of Node JS. I felt pretty awesome with that one
                        console.log, so you can imagine how stoked I was when we moved into reading, writing, and
                        appending files. For me, the unique concept was incorporating process.argv to require input
                        from the user. We were also able to use modules.export to link a file to another, which
                        definitely comes in handy, particularly when hiding API keys.
                    </p>
                    <p>Things quickly advanced when we were introduced to JSON packages. We began by creating a simple
                        inquirer form and moved into using Axios to request data from a website. Learning to initialize
                        packages and then downloading specific packages related to your project is a crucial tool that
                        was necessary for the assignment - creating a LIRI program that provides data about songs,
                        movies, and upcoming concerts. It was a challenging but exciting project that also forced me to
                        hone my Read.me skills - check it out: <a class="blog-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cait-sidener/liri-node-app"><strong>LIRI</strong></a>
