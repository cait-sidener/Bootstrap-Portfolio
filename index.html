                    <h2>The Server and Express</h2>
                    <h6><strong>Learning about Express at the KU Full Stack Bootcamp, Feb 16, 2019</strong></h6>
                    <div class="fakeimg"><img class="blog-pic" alt="MySQL" src="assets/images/express.jpg"></div>
                    <p>When I took my first psychology class (back in 2006), the professor explained that students are
                        portals for information. I should think of myself as an open cardboard box - the content he
                        would be pouring into me over the course of the semester is all of the fun stuff that goes into
                        the box to make it worth keeping in the attic for the remainder of my life. That is why I
                        quickly latched on to the same metaphor used to describe a server and the code and modules I
                        put inside it. I am on the other end of the the metaphor in this scenario!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My big takeaway from building a server is the that it can perform many tasks: Listening,
                        Parsing, Routing, Sending Files, Receiving Posts, Performing Logic, and More. Understanding
                        what the server is capable of set me up with a better comprehension level going into Express,
                        which is (basically) a routing library. On a website, when you deviate to another page off of
                        the homepage, you go to a specific place inside the server.
                    </p>
                    <p>So far, I have used an internal link within my HTML and GitHub to do the work of navigation for
                        me. Now, I am learning how to break it down myself, which is really cool! By the end of class,
                        we were navigating Heroku, which is really just trying to wrap my head around my terminal. We
                        looked at a get versus a post, using the Postman application, and how we can take in user
                        inputs to enhance the website’s experience. It really was a full circle moment for me, as I was
                        somewhat confused of how Node can be used in real life. Quite a lot learned and more to come!

                    <h2>MySQL</h2>
                    <h6><strong>Learning about MySQL at the KU Full Stack Bootcamp, Feb 9, 2019</strong></h6>
                    <div class="fakeimg"><img class="blog-pic" alt="MySQL" src="assets/images/MySQL.png"></div>
                    <p>In class today, I learned about MySQL. Finally, all of my high school years learning how to
                        use
                        Microsof Excel are paying off. Picking up on
                        the commands is intuitive. We started by creating a table
                        with columns which can store strings, integers, and booleans (among other things). I can
                        make a
                        column required and assign individual keys to each row
                        of content.
                    </p>
                    <p>Adding the rows is a bit more taxing than I was expecting. For each new row, you have to
                        write
                        "insert into 'table' + 'column title'" and then you indicate the values desired. To view
                        new
                        values in the table, you then write a new line of code noting which content you would like
                        to
                        display. In all, it is fairly easy going; however, I feel like the work of typing in the
                        values
                        is a bit tedious.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Constructors</h2>
                    <h6><strong>Learning about Constructors at the KU Full Stack Bootcamp, Feb 2, 2019</strong></h6>
                    <div class="fakeimg"><img class="blog-pic" alt="Tamagotchi" src="assets/images/tamagotchi.jpg"></div>
                    <p>Growing up in the aughts meant an unhealthy obsession with Beanie Babies (oh, yeah. I had
                        over
                        200, including TWO Princess Diana’s), a forever battle between loving Backstreet Boys or
                        N’Sync, the mandatory uniform of leggings with foot straps covered with white socks and an
                        oversized sweatshirt, and an anxiety-filled check in with my Tamagotchi. So, you could
                        imagine
                        my surprise when I discovered that we would be making our own Tamagotchis with this handy
                        tool
                        called a Constructor.
                    </p>
                    <p>Constructors are brilliant - I can set up an object with all of the pertinent details needed
                        and simply add the details with each related variable. What’s more? I can add functions
                        within
                        my constructor to give my variables action or a purpose. If my Tamagotchi is tired? Create
                        a
                        function the gives the little guy sleepy time and restores his energy points to max. It is
                        a
                        fairly simple and fun tool to use, instead of creating separate objects for each variable.
                        Some problems I ran in to: remembering to call a function with the variable name in front
                        (i.e
                        tamagotchi.feedMe()) and knowing when to create a function for an individual variable
                        versus as
                        a part of the constructor. Overall, it was a fun day of learning and nostalgia!

                    <h2>Node JS</h2>
                    <h6><strong>Learning about Node at the KU Full Stack Bootcamp, Jan 26, 2019</strong></h6>
                    <div class="fakeimg"><img class="blog-pic" alt="NodeJS" src="assets/images/Nodejs.png"></div>
                    <p>One of the biggest mistakes I make as a new developer is where to put new files. I’ll just
                        nest
                        my project here, within twelve folders that are completely unrelated and seem to all start
                        with
                        the number zero. This decision made my initial experience with Node more difficult than it
                        needed to be. Everyone else was pulling up their file in the Terminal (yes, Bash, but I’m a
                        Apple lady) and squealing with delight when they ran their code that console.logged “Hello
                        World”, while I was still cd’ing into the wrong folders.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once I worked out my issues (I literally had to right click on the file and choose “Open in
                        Terminal”), I was able to experience the magic of Node JS. I felt pretty awesome with that
                        one
                        console.log, so you can imagine how stoked I was when we moved into reading, writing, and
                        appending files. For me, the unique concept was incorporating process.argv to require input
                        from the user. We were also able to use modules.export to link a file to another, which
                        definitely comes in handy, particularly when hiding API keys.
                    </p>
                    <p>Things quickly advanced when we were introduced to JSON packages. We began by creating a
                        simple
                        inquirer form and moved into using Axios to request data from a website. Learning to
                        initialize
                        packages and then downloading specific packages related to your project is a crucial tool
                        that
                        was necessary for the assignment - creating a LIRI program that provides data about songs,
                        movies, and upcoming concerts. It was a challenging but exciting project that also forced
                        me to
                        hone my Read.me skills - check it out: <a class="blog-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cait-sidener/liri-node-app"><strong>LIRI</strong></a>

                    <p>After everything we had learned up until this point, it was finally time to work with a team on
                        my very first project! I really ended up enjoying working with the three other members in my
                        group, but that's not to say we didn't all encounter obstacles along the way. For starters,
                        using GitHub to create branches, commit changes to the right branches, and submitting a pull
                        request without accidentally overriding previous content can be super tricky. Then came the
                        snow days. We really learned what it is like to work remotely, as some of the most important
                        class periods were cancelled due to weather.
                    </p>
                    <p>All in all, I felt like our persistence and open communication ensured that our final product
                        was polished and ready to present. I'm not going to lie, I was super nervous about our
                        presentation! I've been a teacher for five years, but I'm used to talk in front of my sixth
                        grade students. It had been a while since I last spoke in front of my own peers; however, the
                        majority of the class is comprised of ninteen-year-old dudes, so maybe they aren't so far off
                        from my sixth graders. I turned on my "You Got This" switch and ended up having a lot of fun
                        describing our application.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our app is called Right Side of the Bed and it cuts out the noise of social media and internet
                        rabbit holes to give you the commute time, weather, and latest headlines to help you get to
                        your destination on time and informed, instead of visiting multiple applications and getting
                        distracted in the process. I was in charge of creating a headline news button that connects to
                        the New York Times API, a user validation for the weather zip code, music through the Good
                        Vibez radio station, and the to-do list where the user can add and remove items and will stay
